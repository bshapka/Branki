# Branki Readme
Branki (a portmanteau Brant and Anki, the former being my name and latter being a popular flashcard app) is a flashcard
app. As a flashcard app, Branki will provide the following functionality:

* Allow users to create and maintain decks of flashcards
* Allow users to hold study sessions with these decks

I suspect I will be the only person to use this app, although anyone who uses flashcards to study could use it. I am
interested in this project because I've found flashcards to be an effective study method.
